            "shortDescription": "India ranks first among UK immigrant groups, primarily seeking better career and educational opportunities. Well-integrated and vital to the economy, they excel in medicine and finance. Their cultural influence is profound, with traditions and popular dishes like tikka masala becoming staples of modern British life.",
            "fullDescription": "India is the country with the most immigrants within the United Kingdom. Almost a million came to the UK due to better job/degree opportunities. In the way the British look at them, with a positive look, that’s due to their good integration, and they are a big part of our economy. Most of the immigrants from India are working in a kind of similar field of work, which is most of the time medicine, economics, or the real estate market. So for the Indian, it was important to bring a part of their culture to our country not only with their religion and cultural spirit but also with their diverse cuisine with established food, like tika masala, which is roasted chicken in a spicy tomato sauce, or samosas, which are stuffed fried dumplings with either rice, curry, or meat, and these dishes are part of the Indian culture and, in some way, part of our culture nowadays.",

            "shortDescription": "Poland ranks second among UK immigrant groups, attracted by higher wages and quality of life. Well-integrated and sharing similar European traditions, Polish citizens contribute to sectors like IT and medicine. Their presence is marked by a strong work ethic and popular comfort foods like pierogi.",
            "fullDescription": "Poland is in second place with the most immigrants within the UK; for the Polish, the UK was attractive due to higher wages and a better quality of life, and with entry into the UK, the UK was even more attractive. Although we are no longer part of the EU, the Polish ethnicity is still a big part of our country. With the good integration of the Polish popularity, they are part of our community and are rarely victims of racism. Because they immigrated from Europe, the culture is almost similar to our culture; therefore, they also celebrate classic holidays like Christmas or Easter. So is their working culture; they often execute the same jobs they do or did in Poland, so most of them are working in IT, medicine, or for a transportation company. Especially for the rough work, they need heartwarming comfort food, so the pierogi, a meat-filled dumpling, or a variety of soups like bigos, a soup with steamed sauerkraut, and a wide-ranging selection of meat and sausage.",

            "shortDescription": "Over half a million Pakistanis live in the UK, driven by colonial ties and post-war labor needs. Today, they contribute significantly to the economy through high-skilled professions and property ownership. Their presence enriches British society through vibrant cultural traditions, religious practices, and popular culinary staples.",
            "fullDescription": "Pakistan is third on the list of the countries that have the most immigrants within the United Kingdom, with slightly more than half a million. Most of the Pakistanis are living in the UK, because particularly the elder generation served in the military in the Second World War. That's due to the British colonies and Pakistan being one of many colonies. When Pakistanis did not serve in the military, then it is most likely they came to the UK to cover the British shortage in laboratories. Therefore, many people were relieved, but few were outraged because immigrants took the workplaces for others. The outrage by others did not bother the Pakistanis, so they now contribute significantly to our economy, and with their often-seen work in the fields of IT, finance, engineering, and medicine, they are the ethnic group with the most house ownership in the UK and own a large number of properties. For the Pakistanis to feel at home, it was important to bring parts of their culture and traditions to the United Kingdom, so they brought Muslim traditions to our country, for example, Ramadan, which is a fasting month and is always on the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. But not only did they bring traditions, but they also brought typical food, like biryani, which is an aromatic rice dish, or a variety of naans, which are grilled flatbreads often eaten with a wide-ranging option of dips and sauces.",

Primarily working in construction, agriculture, and healthcare, they are essential to the UK workforce. They contribute unique traditions like Mărțișor and traditional dishes such as Sarmale and Mici to British culture.",
            "fullDescription": "Romania is the fourth contender, and with slightly over half a million, they provide the second most immigrants from Europe, and just like the Polish, after the entry into the EU, Romanians also hoped for a better life, better wages, and opportunities in Britain. Due to the regional aspects of Romania, they rarely face stigma because of the history, but nowadays they are essential workers in tertiary sectors, like on construction sites, in agriculture, or in logistics, but not only in physically demanding jobs but also in healthcare or hospitality. Similar to the Polish, they do not have extravagant traditions except for Mărțișor, which is a spring celebration on the first of March. Just like the other countries, the Romanians also brought typical food like Sarmale, which is a cabbage roll, or Mici, a grilled meat roll.",

Beyond professional success in law and media, they enrich the UK with Gaelic football, St. Patrick’s Day celebrations, and traditional comfort foods like boxty and Irish stew.",
            "fullDescription": "Ireland is a neighbor of ours and completes the Top 5 of the countries with the most immigrants, with slightly less than Romania. The reason for the movement to Great Britain is historically conditioned with the 19th-century post-war construction boom. Back then they faced heavy discrimination, but now they are fully integrated and culturally celebrated. Of course, they brought typical traditions over, like St. Patrick’s Day, and they brought a brand new sport called Gaelic football. It is like rugby and proper football had a baby, so it combines elements of both sports, but they don’t only come to our Great Britain to celebrate holidays and play their sport somewhere else; they also work in multiple work fields like law, media, healthcare, or finance to satisfy their hunger. They also took recipes from their families, like Irish soup or boxty, a potato pancake.",
